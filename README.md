# Background

My love of technology began as an enthusiastic 6 year old watching my grandfather build computers for friends and family in his shed. I've been engrossed ever since; working in the IT industry for 10 years before deciding to change my life by moving to the other side of the planet to become a software developer.

My career in IT started right after highschool helping teachers and kids at a couple of small town primary schools keep their technology in order. Over the next few years I moved into Infrastructure and System Administration, IT Managed Services and eventually IT Management for a mid size enterprise - a role that included strategy formulation, vendor management and project management.

I took any chance I could to automate repetitive tasks - usually with simple Windows cmd scripts, but eventually more complex Powershell scripts. At one business I managed to turn a 1 hour user creation process into a 5 second script that could create multiple users at once in multiple systems. This minor foray into coding showed me how satisfying and exciting it is to build a thing and then _see it actually work!_ Being a young professional looking to change my career, moving to London and attending Makers was an obvious choice.

| [Kevstagram](https://kevstagram.herokuapp.com/sign_up) | Kevstagram was made for the last weekend challenge at Makers - clone a popular social network. The previous week had us working with CI and Heroku, so I chose to use these technologies to help me build this project. This was also my first foray into the world of React - which ended up being great fun! | A Weekeend | Rails API backend, React front end, Postgres database |  Travis CI, Heroku PaaS, RSpec for Ruby testing, Rubocop for ruby linting, Cypress for E2E / Feature testing, ESLint for Javascript linting |
| Acebook by Winkyface [API](https://github.com/nateg101/acebook-by-WinkyFace/) / [Front end](https://github.com/robertamangiapane/acebook-react) | Two weeks to clone a popular social network with strict client requirements that were subject to change. With 5 days to go we were asked to convert the app into a SPA and this is what we managed to come up with. | 2 weeks | Rails API backend, React front end, Postgres database |  Travis CI, RSpec for Ruby testing, Rubocop for ruby linting, Cypress for E2E / Feature testing, ESLint for Javascript linting |

# Skills

#### Problem Solving

I have 10 years of IT systems administration and support under my belt, which has helped me create mental models of systems and their interactions, allowing me to quickly formulate troubleshooting steps and testing processes. I have found these skills invaluable when TDDing and debugging software.  
I've also found I actually _thoroughly enjoy_ problem solving and debugging because of this skill set - a bug isn't an annoyance, it's an opportunity to get to know more about a system!

#### Project Management

In my past roles I've been heavily involved in large scale technology projects. Deploying new software to large user groups is something I've done quite a few times, so I have a honed skillset for developing build/test/deployment plans as well as dealing with unexpected issues and delays.

- Upgraded 170 users from Windows 7 to Windows 10, deploying new front end hardware concurrently
- Implemented new software solutions such as Backup, Print Management and Team Collaboration in environments with 200+ users
- upgraded backend virtualisation and storage infrastructure for an environment with 50+ virtual servers

# Hobbies

- I've played in bands since I was 17, so I love anything and everything music. This invloves recording and producing my bands music - I've spent many hours learning how to make audio sound good.  
- Snowboarding, when funds permit
- I used to brew beer, but haven't found room to do it here in London so I've had to settle for trying every craft brew I can get my hands on.
